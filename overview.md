# Content Overview

### How this document works:
Each item is a part of the game. The
highest level are broad topics, which go all the way down to individual
levels at the lowest level. After each item, there's a marker to show
the status of that part of the project. The markers are:

* *future* - this will be covered in the future, but we're unable to
    look into it now.
* *maybe* - We may or may not include this.
* *planned* - we know what we're doing, but nothing about how
* *draft* - we have a draft of this content written
* *poc* - we've got a proof-of-concept level to test the content out
* *written* - we've written all the content for this section
* *assets* - we have all the art assets / VOs for this section
* *implemented* - the assets and content have been smooshed together on
    a publishable level
* *published* - the level has been published. YAY!

If there's no status next to an entry, it means that we'll be working on
it soon but haven't got anything figured out yet.

    - `<p>` - paragraph
    - `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>` - headings
    - `<header>`, `<section>`, `<footer>` - Semantic document sections - perhaps worth leaving til later, when nesting is introduced?

    - Attribute structure - `<open key1="value1" key2="value2"> content </close>`
    - Links - `<a href="..."></a>`
