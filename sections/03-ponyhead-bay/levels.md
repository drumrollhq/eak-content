## Questions
- Hyperlinks are a super-power. How do we control their use throughout the game?

## Stuff to cover:
1. URLs:
  - What are URLs?
  - Reading URLs
  - Writing URLs
2. Links & attributes:
  - What are hyperlinks?
  - Hyperlinks: full information
  - Hyperlinks: partial information
  - Hyperlinks: incorrect information

## 3.1 URLs
We'll cover URLs in a special mini-game. Arca meets a strange creature who claims to be the mayor of Ponyhead bay. Ada leaves Arca and the mayor alone, and goes to (...)? The mayor tells Arca that he will help them if they run a few errands for him. Arca agrees to help. The errands are a variety of tasks that involve reading and writing URLs.

## 3.2 Hyperlinks and attributes
After helping the 'mayor', Arca tells Ada about his tasks. She explains that they could have made things much easier for themselves if they'd used code to create a hyperlink, instead of going to each URL manually. Ada explains hyperlinks to Arca, and writes an example taking them to '404 land'. She tells Arca the URL they just came from, and asks him to create a hyperlink back. Once they return, they carry on traveling through ponyhead bay. At one end of the bay is Donovan Hecklehorn, captain of a submarine. His submarine has been broken into, and he refuses to talk to Arca and Ada until they bring him his favourite comfort food - Mama's JPEG Pie.

Along the bay leading up to Captain Hecklehorn are three buildings. Arca and Ada can enter each building, and complete small code puzzles to help out the creatures in each building. Two of the code puzzles relate to creating links, and the other revises creating `<p>` tags. After completing each puzzle, the creatures inhabiting the building give Arca a small token of their gratitude:

- An antique pie crust from the baker
- A packet of old JPEG scratchings (kind of like pork scratchings?) from the dodgy sailor's pub
- A jar of sweaty mum-love, from "Marjory's fine stink-things", which is basically one of those repugnant 'Lush' shops except they have a weird nautical theme?

After collecting all the ingredients for Mama's JPEG pie and delivering the pie to Captain Hecklehorn, he stops crying for long enough to explain his predicament. His submarine has been stolen, and he can't get it back. Arca and Ada need to create a hyperlink into the submarine, where a load of exciting stuff happens. Dun dun dar!
