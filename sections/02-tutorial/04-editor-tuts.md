# 2.4 - Using the Editor and Tutorial System - Tutorials
In this section, we need to teach people:
* How to use the editor - Undo, Redo, Reset, Save, Cancel.
* Editor Helpers - highlighting the edited element, the way you can
    click elements to select them in the editor
* The quirks of the tutorial guide - selecting different bits of
    tutorial, using the help button, etc.

I have no idea how we do this effectively as levels or have it
integrated nicely into the game.
