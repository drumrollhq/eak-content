# 2.2 - Using Portals - Tutorials

This is merged in with [controlling Arca](01-control-arca.md) at the
moment, but could probably do with some more thought. Also, for levels
that are in very similar geographical locations (i.e. different rooms in
a house), portals don't make a great deal of sense. We should probably
have a few ways of getting between levels:

* Portals, for going between places far apart.
* Doors, for the rooms-in-house example above
* Borders. Level edges should take users somewhere that makes sense when
    you walk through them
