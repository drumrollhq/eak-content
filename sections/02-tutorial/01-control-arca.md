# 2.1 - Controlling Arca - Tutorial

Currently, we handle this pretty well.

### Current Solution:
* We present a simple level: Arca on one side, the portal and kitten on
    the other. Between them, is a small obstacle to jump over.
* A pointer tells the user that they are Arca, and that they can use the
    arrow keys to move
* A pointer indicates the obstacle, and tells the user that they can use
    the space key to jump
* A pointer tells the user that they need to walk into kittens in order
    to save them
* A pointer tells the user about portals

### Observations & problems
This level is actually pretty good. It has by far the lowest drop-off
rate. However, there are a few points on which people occaisionally get
stuck:

* When jumping the obstacle, people don't realise that they need to jump
    and move right at the same time
* They sometimes jump *over* the kitten, without collecting it
* They don't always get the portals initially

Changing this level is pretty low priority, but something we should do
eventually. We should split it up into maybe 2 or 3 to give people a
chance to practice the skills they're learning.
