We need to introduce the concept of being able to edit the world of thr game you are playing. This is a pretty massive idea, so we'll need to break it down to an extent.

Not being overwhelming here is hard - we need to show that edit view to people and get them to change something without them getting lost.

## Run through:
* There are two ledges either side of the level, with a gap between
    them. Arca is on one side, and the kitten and is on the other:

    ```
        ______________________
        |                    |
        | A              k P |
        |===            =====|
        |                    |
        |____________________|
    ```
* The user tries to jump over to the other side, but falls and dies -
    *is this a good idea? Maybe we shouldn't force people to die as
    much?*
* Lao and Ada swoop down riding Cecil, saving Arca.
* Lao introduces the concept of coding
* They are prompted to edit the level. A stripped down version of the
    edit view comes up, with a really focussed guided tour type thing
    that demonstrates and walks them through:
  * Selecting the ledge they are on
  * Typing their name in to make the ledge longer
  * Typing some more stuff to make the ledge reach the other side
  * Pressing save to finish
* In this level, there is no mention of the fact that what is being
    edited is HTML
