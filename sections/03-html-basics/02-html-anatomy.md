# 3.2 - Structure of a HTML element - HTML Basics

Here, we're introducing the basic structure of a HTML element. An opening tag, followed by some content, and finished with a closing tag:
```html
  <open> content </close>
```

This will set the foundation that the other levels in this section will build on, so it's important that we get it absolutely right. In these levels, we need to introduce the following terms:
- Tag
- Element
- Opening Tag
- Closing Tag

After playing, people should be able to recognize why these are wrong:
- `<p> hello`
- `<p< hello </p>`
- `<p> hello <p>`

And be able to write the correct `<p> hello </p>`.

At this stage, they do not need to know more than one type of HTML element.

Here, the user needs to create two extra ledges in order to reach the kitten and the portal. A tutorial will guide them through creating a HTML element - first adding a opening `<p>`, then some content, then a closing `</p>`.

For the next element, the user is 'on their own' - although help should be available if needed.
