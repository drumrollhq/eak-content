# 1.3 Editing Text I

- Pink pantaloons! You actually did it! Perhaps you could learn some code...
- This writing on the left is the code for your surroundings - shown on the right.
- Let's try changing the code. Click the black writing here.
- [highlight place to click]
- Now, type your name. 
- [wait for name to be written]
- See how changing the code changes your surroundings? Keep typing to make the ledge long enough for you to reach the other side. You can write anything you want

- Smashing work my little vegetable soup! You picked that up faster than a squirrel on a scooter.

# 1.5 Editing Text II
- In game:
	- Yep, try to avoid the creepy tree-hands. They really don't get 'personal space'
	- Seems we need to do some more coding. Click edit or press E. Come on!
- First off, this is the editor. You can press 'save' when you're done, or 'cancel' to return to the game - 'cancel' will get rid of your changes though, so watch out!
- One of the best ways to solve these things is to just experiment and try things out. It doesn't matter if you mess things up - just press 'reset' to put the code back to how it started
- If you need any help, click this 'help' button here. Try pressing it now.
- These ledges are too long. Try deleting some of the black text to create a safe path into the cave.
- Just like before, click on the black writing here:
- [wait for click]
- Now, delete some of the text to make the ledge shorter.
- Great! Press save, and let's get going.

- In game:
	- Whoa. What *is* that thing? (octobaby says "I'm octo-baby" or something)
	- Looks like we need to find another way to get down. Open up the editor so we can get out of here
	- No, see, jumping off again and again isn't going to work!
	- Remember, you need to click 'Edit' or press 'E' to open up the editor.
- You need to create two more boxes to get to the bottom. Follow the same pattern as the existing boxes to make a new one
- Start with a `<p>`.
- This means "start a box".
- Next, write the contents of your box.
- Finish off with `</p>`.
- This means "I've finished the box".
- To type those weird pointy brackets, hold down the shift key, then press the key with the pointy bracket you want.
- Looking good.

# 2.3
- Animation:
  - Before we go on, I need to explain something. Just cause you're a newbie. Yay, theory lessons... 
  - When you're writing code, you're writing instructions that a computer will follow exactly.
  - Code is your paintbrush for the Internet Universe. If you know enough code, you can create anything you want.
  - Turns out you've been writing a type of code called HTML this whole time.
  - HTML is the coding language used to create almost everything on the web.
  - This language is made of building blocks called 'tags'.
  - This is an opening p tag, and this is a closing p tag. Together, they make a p 'element'.
  - The names of the opening and closing tags always have to match.
  - Phew! Glad that's over with. Did you get all that?

- Tutorial:
  - You need another box like before - so create a P element by following the pattern from last time
  - If you can't remember how to write the p element for the box, go back to the ones you just made, and look at the code you wrote there.
  - OK, start with a `<p>` opening tag.
  - Next, write something - make sure it's long enough!
  - Finish of with a `</p>` closing tag.
  - You're actually getting the hang of this!

#2.5
- Right! Let's get these engine's fixed
- Remember the code you just wrote? Use that pattern to fix the error in the code.
- This element needs an opening and closing tag. Does it look like everything is here?
- You need to add a closing `</p>` tag to this element

# 2.6
- This element's closing tag isn't actually a closing tag...
- The closing tag needs a slash after the opening pointy bracket: `</p>`

# 2.7
- There's two closing tags!
- The first tag has a slash in it, like a closing tag. But it's supposed to be an opening tag.

# 2.8
- This one's tricky. The slash in the closing tag isn't in the right place.
- The slash in a closing tag should be before the 'p', not after.

- We did it! Engine's fixed. Let's go find that Tarquin guy.

# 2.9
- Wow. He actually does have a disco ball in his office.
- Wow. Who has a disco ball in their office?
